Guide: main.py Key Components and Setup
This guide provides an overview of the key components and setup in the main.py file for the FastAPI backend, file uploads, and API endpoints.

1. FastAPI App Initialization
The FastAPI app is initialized with the following:

python
Copy
app = FastAPI()
This creates an instance of the FastAPI application that serves as the backend.

2. CORS Configuration
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows the frontend application to interact with the backend without running into issues related to cross-origin requests. In development, it allows the frontend running on localhost:3000 to communicate with the backend on localhost:8000.

python
Copy
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "https://your-frontend.com"],  # Development and production frontend URLs
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allows all HTTP methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allows all headers
)
allow_origins: Set the allowed origins for CORS (frontend URLs).
allow_methods: Allows all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
allow_headers: Allows all headers.
3. File Uploads
The backend handles file uploads through two endpoints:

Simulate AI Processing (/upload):

python
Copy
@app.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Simulate AI processing after file upload
    # Save file locally or process as needed
    ai_response = {"filename": file.filename, "analysis": "AI detected a high-action scene with fast transitions."}
    return ai_response
Upload to AWS S3 (/uploadfile/):

python
Copy
@app.post("/uploadfile/")
async def create_upload_file(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    allowed_file_types = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "application/pdf"]
    if file.content_type not in allowed_file_types:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid file type")
    
    background_tasks.add_task(upload_to_s3, file, file.filename)  # Upload to S3 in the background
    return {"filename": file.filename, "message": "Upload started in the background", "success": True}
upload_to_s3 function: Handles uploading files to an AWS S3 bucket asynchronously using aioboto3.

python
Copy
async def upload_to_s3(file: UploadFile, file_path: str):
    try:
        async with get_s3_client() as s3:
            await s3.upload_fileobj(file.file, S3_BUCKET_NAME, file.filename)
        logger.info(f"File {file.filename} uploaded to S3 successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error uploading file {file.filename} to S3: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"File upload failed: {str(e)}")
File Type Validation: Before uploading to S3, file type validation is performed to ensure that only certain file types (e.g., image/jpeg, image/png, application/pdf) are accepted.
4. Database Integration
The backend uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions. A helper function get_db() provides a database session for each request:

python
Copy
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()  # Create a new session
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()  # Close session after request
This session is used in service classes for database operations.

5. Project Endpoints
Create Project (/projects/ POST):

python
Copy
@app.post("/projects/", response_model=ProjectSchema)
async def create_project(project: ProjectSchema, project_service: ProjectsService = Depends(get_project_service)):
    new_project = project_service.create_project(name=project.name, description=project.description)
    return new_project
Get Projects (/projects/ GET):

python
Copy
@app.get("/projects/", response_model=List[ProjectSchema])
async def get_projects(project_service: ProjectsService = Depends(get_project_service)):
    projects = project_service.get_projects()
    return projects
These endpoints interact with the ProjectsService to manage projects in the database.

6. Environment Variables and AWS Configuration
The backend uses environment variables for sensitive configurations such as database credentials and AWS keys. Ensure these are set in your .env file:

bash
Copy
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION_NAME=your_aws_region
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
7. Logging
Logging is configured using Pythonâ€™s logging library. All major events such as file uploads and errors are logged:

python
Copy
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
This allows for tracking file uploads and troubleshooting when needed.

Summary:
FastAPI Setup: The app is initialized using FastAPI() and includes key routes like file uploads and project management.
CORS: Configured to allow the frontend (React app) to make requests to the backend.
File Uploads: Files are uploaded either locally or to AWS S3 in the background.
Database: SQLAlchemy sessions are used for managing database interactions.
Project Endpoints: Routes to create and retrieve projects.
Environment Variables: Used for configuring sensitive information like AWS credentials and database connection strings.
Logging: Helps track and debug errors.
